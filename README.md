## 🚀 Local website development

Want to help improve the unitaryhack website?
The website is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
The [Fernfolio](https://fernfolio.netlify.app/) template was used to bootstrap the design.
Here are some basic local setup steps to get you started:
### Local environment
- Clone the repo locally `git clone https://github.com/unitaryfund/unitaryhackdev.git`
- Navigate to root folder `cd untitaryhack2022`
- Install the goods `npm install`
- Run it `npm start`
- You should now be able to see everything running on localhost:8080
- Make a Pull Request to add your changes to github. Once approved, an auto-deploy should be triggered 🎉

## 💻 Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Generate minified production build

Checkout the Eleventy [Command Line Usage docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/) for more options.
