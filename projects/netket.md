NetKet uses Machine-Learning ideas to address some hard problems in Quantum Physics, such as finding the ground-state or solving the dynamics of a quantum system, or enhancing a tomographic reconstruction from some experimental data. It is built around neural-network quantum states and provides efficient algorithms for their evaluation and optimization.  NetKet is a Python package based on Google's Jax library. 

If you are not familiar with NetKet, you can learn more by looking at [our documentation](https://netket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or by inspecting [this tutorial](https://netket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gs-ising.html).

We are welcoming contributors with a Physics or Machine Learning background to work on some algorithmic tasks, those with a quantum computing background to work on our integration with other packages, and those without to work on the structure of the codebase itself.
