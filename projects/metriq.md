The purpose of the [metriq](metriq.info) platform is to allow users to answer the following question:

_How does quantum computing platform "X" running software stack "Y" perform on workload "Z", and how has that changed over time?_

The goal of metriq is to become a focal point for present benchmarking efforts sprouting up in the quantum ecosystem.
Developers and companies can submit benchmarking results easily, via web form or Python client.
