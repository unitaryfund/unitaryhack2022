1. unitaryhack is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for quantum projects to contribute to for the first time, please **[sign up here]( {{ '/signup/' | url }} )** so we know to look for your contributions! There are some limitations about where we can ship physical swag, see the [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions) below.
2. A contribution to a participating project for this hackathon consists of making a pull request yourself to the project's repository. You can find a list of participating quantum open source projects [here]( {{ '/projects/' | url }} ), with a list of all bountied issues that have additional cash awards. For pull requests resolving bountied issues, the first accepted PR from the project maintainers will receive the prize, so make sure the contact info you sign-up for the contest with is correct!
3. Hackers can make contributions anytime between June 3rd and June 17th. Just be sure to [sign up here]({{ '/signup/' | url }}) and make sure that you put `[unitaryhack]` in the title of your PR so the bots can find your contributions and make sure you get credit! You can look for [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=unitaryhack&type=repositories) with the `unitaryhack` topic for inspiration, or look for specifically bountied issues by searching `unitaryhack-bounty`. Quality contributions are encouraged, see some discussion of what makes a good pull request from the [Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality).
4. All participants and maintainers must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct as well as the Unitary Fund [Community Code of Conduct]({{ '/coc/' | url }}).

If you have any questions about the event or want to get in touch with others working on the event, join our [Discord](http://discord.unitary.fund)! Share your hacks on social media with the tag #unitaryhack2022 and we will also be featuring some of the best contributions from the hackathon on our [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/unitaryfund) after the event.

## Terms and Conditions

We will do our best to ensure that we can get swag and bounties sent to all who qualify for, but there are some challenges associated with sending money or physical swag packs to countries that have restrictions on shipping or sanctions from the USA.
We are able to send bounties and ship physical swag packs to most countries with the following exception: Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.
